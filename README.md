# Victor's DevLog / Portfolio
Made *from scratch*, Boostrap based **no-database article framework** to showcase my projects.
Uses **JSON files** to *dynamically generate article pages*.


Basically a *very minified* version of my:
- Life as a dev.
- Work projects.
- **Personal projects.**
- Code pills (useful tips & tricks).

> **Note:** I have **A TON** of _unreleased projects_ that I have worked on over the years:
> <br>Some projects are old, code quality may vary from project to project.
> <br>All in all it shows how I have been **improving over the years** and this site is a way for having a **_backlog_** or "time machine" for old projects while also serving as **my portfolio**.
