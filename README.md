## Victor's DevLog / Portfolio
Basically a *very minified* version of my:
- Life as a dev.
- Work projects.
- **Personal projects.**
- Code pills (useful tips & tricks).

> **Note:** I have **A TON** of _unreleased projects_ that I have worked on over the years:
> <br>Some that I am proud of and some that I'd now honestly start from scratch.
> <br>All in all it shows how I have been **improving over the years** and this site is a way for me to be able to, **_look back_** and see my progress while acting as a backog or "time machine" for old projects.
