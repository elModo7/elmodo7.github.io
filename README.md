## Victor's DevLog / Portfolio
Basically a *very minified* version of my:
- Life as a dev.
- Work projects.
- **Personal projects.**
- Code pills (useful tips & tricks).

> **Note:** I have **A TON** of _unreleased projects_ that I have worked over the years:
> Some that I am proud of and some that I'd honestly start from scratch.
> All in all it shows how I have been **improving over the years** and this site is a way for me to be able to, in the future, **_look back_** and see what I was writing time ago.
