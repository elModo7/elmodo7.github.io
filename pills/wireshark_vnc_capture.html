		<h2>Exploiting the vulnerability</h2>
		<p>
			I use <b>VNC</b> quite a bit for accessing my home boxes.<br>While I rely on <b>RDP</b> mostly for Windows machines I do use VNC as fallback and when I want to use desktop apps on my Linux devices.
			<br><br>
			VNC, by default, is <b>NOT secure</b>, all inputs are sent in plain-text, you can think of it as the <i>"telnet"</i> of remote desktops.
			<br>
			This leads into <b>big security risks</b>, like <i>credentials sniffing</i> and such.
			<br><br>
			In this article, we will learn <b>how to exploit this vulnerability</b> as simple as possible, using <b>Wireshark</b> for two common VNC clients, like <b>RealVNC Viewer</b> and <b>TightVNC Viewer</b>.
			<br><br>
			If we <i>start capturing packets</i> with Wireshark, we can apply this filter, to only get inputs sent using VNC to a specific host.
			<br>The variable <code>&lt;ip_dst&gt;</code> is the one we are interested in replacing with our target VNC Server IP:
		</p>
		<pre class="col-md-12"><code class="language-clike">((tcp || vnc) && ip.dst_host == &lt;ip_dst&gt;) && (data.len == 8 || frame.len == 62)</code></pre>
		<p>
			<br>This example is me sending <b>"hello world"</b> to one of my computers <b>outside of my home LAN</b>:
			<br><br><img class="shadow-lg article-inner-image" src="static/img/pills/wireshark_vnc_capture_filter/hello_world_capture.gif"></img><br>
			<br>You can see how the <b><span style="color:blue;">highlighted in blue</span></b> (at the bottom) output shows clearly visible the <b>"hello world"</b> I typed while capturing.
			<br>We see <b>two packets per key input</b> because this client sends two events, one for <b>key down</b> and a <b>key up</b> event each time we type something.
			<br><br>One could just make a rule to skip every <b>key_up</b> event and start logging all traffic that would match our filter, then <b>remove the ip_dst</b> restriction, capturing that way all outbound VNC traffic inputs.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Protecting against it</h2>
		<p>
			One way we could be protecting against this kind of attack is by using a <b>VPN</b> or <b>tunneling the connection</b>.
			<br>In later articles I may update this one, because I have been doing a <i>few tunnels, <u>specifically</u> for VNC</i>, but this time we will be tunneling our connection using my <b><a href="?article=/personal_projects/tunnel_manager/article.html&title=SSH%20Tunnel%20Manager&description=A%20GUI%20wrapper%20for%20plink%20with%20profiling,%20notifications%20and%20more." target="_blank">SSH Tunnel Manager</a></b>.
			<br><b><a href="?article=/personal_projects/tunnel_manager/article.html&title=SSH%20Tunnel%20Manager&description=A%20GUI%20wrapper%20for%20plink%20with%20profiling,%20notifications%20and%20more." target="_blank">SSH Tunnel Manager</a></b> is a tool that allows us to use our <b>existing SSH Server for securely tunneling connections</b>.
			<br><br>In this case we are going to configure a tunnel like this:
			<br><br><a href="?article=/personal_projects/tunnel_manager/article.html&title=SSH%20Tunnel%20Manager&description=A%20GUI%20wrapper%20for%20plink%20with%20profiling,%20notifications%20and%20more." target="_blank"><img class="article-inner-image shadow-lg" src="static/img/pills/wireshark_vnc_capture_filter/tunnel_manager.png"></img></a>
			<br><br>This will allow us to connect to <b>127.0.0.1:51900</b> <i>(localhost)</i> through port <b>51900</b> and that will be <b>securely redirected to our VNC Server endpoint</b> at 192.168.1.128:5900.
			<br>In this case we are using a <i>local IP address</i> but you get the idea. We can use this to secure our WAN VNC sessions.
			<br><br>Now if we <i>scan again with Wireshark</i>, we will not only not be able to read the packets, but also this filter is no longer usable, everything goes through the <b>SSH protocol, encrypted and unreadable</b>.
			<br><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i><i> Of course encryption strength is based on the algorythm we use for the session and the length and complexity of the passphrase.</i>
			<br><br><br>And this would conclude our pill for today, note this is actually <b>the first pill that I write</b> and I'm using <b>the first version of my articles's framework</b>, but I think it's starting to look decent after all ðŸ˜€.
